# AnySync


AnySync is an open-source desktop application for Windows & Mac. It helps you manage your anime library, discover new series, share watched episodes and download new ones. It requires an [AniList.co](https://anilist.co) account.

## Why AnySync?
Why not?
The AnySync idea was born one day, while I wasn't able to find any software like [Taiga](https://github.com/erengy/taiga), so I decided to create my own version but using Java.
I'd like to create a multi-platform application that every user could use.

## When AnySync will be ready to be released?
Actually I don't have planned any date for the release, not even for an Alpha version.
I think that this program should be released when it'll be ready, and right now it isn't.

### How the work on this software is going?
Better then I expected. I'm saying that because I'm developing this software all alone so I'm very slow.
Sometimes some of my friends help me, even if their help is minor it's appreciated.

### Bug?
Yes! In every software there are bugs but right now I'm in search for them, and I'm search for bugs that would not allow the software to run correctly on all the platforms. I'm just ensuring that the class that do the POST request and the class that require to [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) the authorization pin work correctly.
